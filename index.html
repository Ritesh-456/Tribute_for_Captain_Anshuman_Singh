        <h3>Martyr:</h3>
        <section>
            <p>
                In July 2023, a few months after his martyrdom, Captain Anshuman Singh Sia's wife left for Australia for
                higher education in structural engineering. Captain Anshuman Singh was serving with 403 Field Hospital
                of 26 Punjab Battalion on attachment to 26 Madras deployed in Chin Glacier. The area remained
                inaccessible during the winter months and the troops were exposed to extreme risk while manning the
                forward posts in inaccessible terrain at an altitude of over 19,000 feet in extreme weather conditions.
                Apart from manning the designated posts, the troops also carried out regular patrolling to monitor the
                gaps between the posts. Captain Anshuman Singh, serving as the Regimental Medical Officer, was
                responsible for providing medical care to all the troops deployed in the area.
                <br>
                At around 3 am on 19 July 2023, a fire broke out in the ammunition depot at Chandan Dropping Zone,
                Siachen. Captain Anshuman heard the sound of fire and rushed out of his fibre glass hut. Captain
                Anshuman quickly realised that many of his soldiers were trapped inside and needed to be rescued.
                Without caring for his own safety, he was fully aware of the risk and immediately rushed forward to
                rescue his fellow soldiers. Despite the dangerous surroundings and the threat posed by the fire, he
                fearlessly went into the affected area and was determined to search for survivors and evacuate them to
                safety. Exhibiting quick thinking and fearless leadership, Captain Anshuman Singh managed to rescue four
                to five individuals from a nearby fibre glass hut, which was rapidly filling with smoke and was on the
                verge of catching fire. His calm demeanour and clear instructions helped to evacuate these individuals
                to safety, reflecting his remarkable ability to remain calm even under pressure. He then noticed that
                the medical examination room was on fire. He went inside his fibreglass hut to retrieve the medical aid
                box, however, he was unable to get out as the fire spread and engulfed his shelter due to strong winds.
                Despite repeated attempts, he could not be rescued. His body was retrieved from the shelter after the
                fire was extinguished.
